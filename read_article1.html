                <h3>3 Most Intelligent Cats To Adopt If You Want A Clever Companion</h3>
                <p class="authour">

                    It's a truth universally acknowledged that if you're looking for a smart pet, 
                    cats are a pretty good way to go. But figuring out the smartest cat breeds 
                    depends on how you define smarts. Cats aren't actually that obedient when it 
                    comes to standard intelligence tests.
                    Professor Mary Bly explained to Purina, "Dogs come when they’re called; 
                    cats take a message and get back to you.” However, the breeds that are deemed 
                    to have the most intelligence when it comes to humans are the ones who are the
                    most sociable and willing to learn — so if you're looking for a hyper-intelligent
                    cat, you'll be recommended a breed that has a reputation for showing off its 
                    smarts. Many other cats may be perfectly intelligent, but have no inclination 
                    to demonstrate it at all.
                </p>
                <p class="reading regular">
                    Be warned that if you want an intelligent cat, you'll likely adopt an animal 
                    that thinks for itself — and might outsmart you on the regular. Here are five 
                    of the smartest cat breeds.
                </p>
                <h5>1. Bengals</h5>
                <img src="img/article/cat1.jpg">
                <p class="reading regular">
                    These chatty beauties are among the top most intelligent cat breeds, 
                    according to research by Purina. Bengals have only existed in their current 
                    form since the 1980s, and are crosses between domestic cats and Asian Leopard 
                    Cats. Bengals are marked by their ability to learn tricks, though their own 
                    intelligence means they make the choice about whether to obey or not. They're 
                    also one of the sole recommended cat breeds for leash training. Bengals are 
                    hyper-interested in their environments and will do everything from switching off 
                    lights to opening windows and cupboards. They also love water and will play in 
                    baths and puddles whenever they get the chance.

                <h5>2. Abyssinian</h5>
                <img src="img/article/cat2.jpg">
                <p class="reading regular">
                   The Abyssinian cat is a beautiful animal — females are small and sleek, while males 
                   are huge and can look like orange lions — that pairs image with intelligence. 
                   The breed is thought to have emerged from Ethiopia, and made its way over as a 
                   pet to Europe in the late 1800s. Abyssinians are also known as "Aby-grabbies", 
                   according to Purina, because of their tendency to get hold of anything that grabs 
                   their interest, from toys to human appliances to wires.
                </p>
                <h5>3. Siamese</h5>
                <img src="img/article/cat3.jpg">
                <p class="reading regular">
                    The classic "intelligent cat," the Siamese slim-faced breed is generally 
                    blue-eyed and pale with large ears. It originally hails from Thailand, and 
                    is extremely affectionate and trainable, hence its reputation for smarts. Like 
                    Bengals, Siamese are incredibly chatty, with a particular vocalization known as 
                    the "Siamese wail" unique to the breed.
